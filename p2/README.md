## Parter policy for this assignment

We do accept partner work on this project. If you are in a team (max two people) to finish this assignment, only one of the team members should submit their assignment. **The submitted repo should have a README file that write ALL the team members' names right at the top of the file before anything within the file**

## Overview

In this project, you'll perform basic and advanced analysis of the Chinook database using SQL queries and functions.

Learning objectives:
* setup a docker container with mysql server
* write basic SQL queries for data retrieval
* perform complex joins across multiple tables
* group and aggregate data using SQL functions
* utilize window functions for advanced analysis

Before starting, please review the [general project directions](../projects.md).

You will be answering 35 questions. **We recommend getting started with the project early.**

## Setting up MySQL using Docker

**WARNING:** **DO NOT** forget to stop and remove the `docker` container which we are using during lecture for "IMDB dataset" analysis. Running both containers simultaneously will make your VM terribly slow. 

For this project, we'll be using the `mysql` image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=mysql). You can `pull` the `mysql` image using the below command:

```bash
docker pull mysql
```
**Note:** if you are still using `sudo` to run `docker` commands, please follow the steps here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user
(don't go beyond the "Manage Docker as a non-root user" section).

Then, launch a docker container running MySQL server using this command:

```bash
docker run --name <container-name> -d -p 127.0.0.1:3306:3306 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=Chinook -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456 mysql
```

Now start a new program (`bash`) in the existing docker container using the below docker command:

```bash
docker exec -it <container-name> bash
```
You can use this session for your experimentation of the database.

## Setting up `jupyter` on your VM

In a new terminal / powershell window, open another ssh session to your VM. Create a new directory to keep track of your p2 files (of course don't forget to `cd` into it). 

If you haven't already installed these packages on your VM, make sure to complete the below installations:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip wget unzip
```
```bash
sudo pip3 install jupyter
pip3 install SQLAlchemy mysql-connector-python pandas nbformat nbconvert
```

Then, launch `jupyter` using the below command

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

To access the `jupyter` session on your laptop, you must establish an `ssh` tunnel. Open a new terminal or powershell tab, then use the below command to establish your tunnel:

```bash
ssh <USER>@IP -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888
```
If port 8888 is occupied on your laptop, you can change the first port (source port) in the above command to a different port number.

Then, create a new Notebook file (File > New > Notebook) and make sure to save it as `p2.ipynb`.

## Writing code in `p2.ipynb` to set up ```Chinook``` database 

1. Inside your notebook, use the appropriate `bash` command to download zip file ```Chinook``` dataset. For the URL part, you should be using the raw URL from github: `https://github.com/CS639-Data-Management-for-Data-Science/f24/raw/main/p2/Chinook.zip`. **Note:** During the lecture, we covered how to run bash command from inside notebook file. If required, please review lecture demo code.
2. Write code to invoke appropriate `bash` command to unzip the zip file.

### Loading ```Chinook``` database

1. In a new cell, make sure to type in the necessary `import` statements.
2. Following that, create a new cell to establish connection to your `mysql-server` using `create_engine` function from `sqlalchemy` module.
3. Then use load the content of each `csv` file into the database.
   * Your database table name must match with each csv file name (including the case).
   * There is an efficient way to load all the csv files without having to type each csv file's name.
   * If you are not familiar with the `os` module `listdir` function, please look it up.
   * You can use a combination of string methods and the `os` module to load all csv files without having to type individual files names. 

## Section 1: Basic SQL commands (14 questions)

You are a data analyst in the Chinook company who has just been asked to conduct a full analysis of sales data of the artist named "Queen" in your database. The company needs to understand how well a specific artist is performing by reviewing the tracks sold, the total revenue generated, and customer information related to purchases. Your final goal is to present a summary of sales and customer details for that artist.

**Requirement:** Use subquery to answer the questions in section 1. We'll have an entire section dedicated to joins.

### Part 1: Analysis of the artist "Queen"

We would recommend you to explore all the tables by using appropriate SQL queries to display the corresponding table rows. Also, to make your notebook readable, we recommend copy/pasting the questions into mark down cells above your solution cell. You can use `####` mark down syntax to highlight each question.

**Requirement**: Each solution cell should be marked using the appropriate question number as a comment. For example, at the beginning of the cell answering question 1, you should have this comment: "#q1".

#### Q1: Retrieve all information about the artist "Queen" from the Artist table.

Each question's resultant `pandas DataFrame` must be stored into a file called `q\<N\>.pkl`, where `N` refers to the question number. For example, store q1's results using the below code:

```
q1_df = pd.read_sql(...)
q1_df.to_pickle("q1.pkl")
```
Make sure to go back to the cell containing import statements and include `import pickle`.

For your personal verification, you can display the output of the `pandas DataFrame` as well.

#### Q2: What are all the albums released by the artist "Queen"?

Your SQL query answering this question should be self-sufficient - that is, you should not be hardcoding the `ArtistId` that you determined from the previous question. **Harcoding will make you lose points during manual TA review**.

**Requirement:** Use subquery to answer this question and other questions in section 1. We'll have an entire section dedicated to joins.

#### Q3: What are all the tracks released by the artist "Queen"? 

Again, we expect your SQL query to be self-sufficient. **Do not hardcode** any of the identifiers. If you hardcoded the `ArtistID` for the previous question, now would be the time for you to go back and fix it. **Harcoding will make you lose points during manual TA review**.

**Requirement:** Use subquery to answer this question and other questions in section 1. We'll have an entire section dedicated to joins.

#### Q4: How many tracks released by "Queen" were composed or co-composed by "Queen"?

**Requirement:** Your result should have count column named as `TotalQueenTracks`

#### Q5: Who are all the composers of tracks by the artist "Queen"?

**Requirement:** Your result should only include unique composer names.

#### Q6: Which are the top 5 longest tracks by the artist "Queen"?

#### Q7: What are all the tracks by the artist "Queen" that are sized smaller than 6MB?

1000000 bytes = 1 MB

Wasn't it a pain to read the relevant results from the last two queries? How about we make this data more human readable for the next question?

#### Q8: Generate human-readable details about all tracks released by "Queen".

**Requirement:** Other than track names, your result should have two columns named `DurationMinutes` and `FileSize` in MB.

### Part 2: Customer and employee analysis

Let's now explore the customers to see if there is some trend.

#### Q9: Who are all the customers from USA?

**Requirement:** Your result should include `CustomerId`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `State` information for the customers. The rows should be ordered using ascending order of the `State` names.

#### Q10: Which invoices correspond to transactions costing greater than $20?

#### Q11: Which invoices were issued in the year 2021?

#### Q12: What was the total expenditure of "Eduardo Martins"?

**Requirement:** It is acceptable to hardcode first and the last name here. But it is not acceptable to hardcode customer id.

#### Q13: Which customers from the USA do not have any specified company information?

#### Q14: Who are all the Canadian employess?

## Section 2: In-depth analysis of Queen data with `JOIN` clauses (10 questions)

### Part 2: Windowing queries

Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, enabling advanced analysis without collapsing data.

#### Q31: Find each track's duration and rank all tracks by their duration.

**Requirements:** 
* Your results must include the `TrackId`, track name `TrackName`, duration in minutes `DurationMinutes`, and corresponding duration rank `DurationRank`.
* Ranking should be based on descending order of duration.
* Your results should be ordered by ascending order of ascending order of duration rank. If two tracks have the same rank, then they should be ordered based on descending order of duration in minutes.
* **UPDATED REQUIREMENT:** Your results should also be ordered by ascending order of `TrackId`.

#### Q32: Rank customers who purchased tracks by "Queen" based on their total expenditure.

**Requirements:**:
* Your results must include the `CustomerId`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, corresponding invoices count `InvoicesCount`, and corresponding invoice rank `InvoiceRank`.
* Ranking:
  * Ranks assigned to customers must be unique and based on descending order of invoices count. That is customer with highest invoices count should receive rank 1.
  * If there are ties in invoices count, you must break ties by using ascending order of `LastName`. 

#### Q34: Find the top 3 invoices per country.

**Hints:** 
* This is a challenging question.
* Break it down into individual steps:
  1. Determine invoice rank `InvoiceRank` using descending order of `Total`. Make sure order the results both using ascending order of `BillingCountry` and `Total`.
  2. Then, write another query which uses the query you wrote in step 1 as sub query to filter invoices with top 3 ranks.

**Requirements:** 
* Your results must include the `BillingCountry`, `InvoiceId`, `Total`, and corresponding invoice rank `InvoiceRank`.
* Ranking should be based on descending order of `Total`.
